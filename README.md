# Project-Overview
This project was made for fun and nothing else, I wanted to gain knowledge on console UI's, code efficiency and code layout. The program is super basic and has nothing really to it, just a simple stats viewer in .net console that uses 3rd party API's.

# Library's-Used
*[Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole) Very nice UI features, easy to use but has some multiple threading difficulties.
*[Leaf.xNet](https://github.com/csharp-leaf) I've used this for years now, very noob friendly compared to other http librarys, has some dope other features.

# How-To-Use
Just enter the IGN you want to lookup, and the program will go through a 3rd party API and grab specific information about that player. Has a back to menu feature which allows easy navigation throughout the program.
